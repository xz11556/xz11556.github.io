<h3>The story of classic Zheng music "High Mountains and Flowing River"</h3> 

<div style= "font-size:14pt"> When the famous Zheng master Boya was playing the Zheng in the countryside, 
a carpenter named Ziqi passed by and thought his music projected the image of the high mountains and the flowing rivers.
 Boya was impressed that even a carpenter could interpret the piece, he then befriended the carpenter, who soon became his best friend. 
 After Ziqi had died, Boya lost his only friend who could thoroughly understand him through his melodies; 
 he then broke his Zheng and had never touched it ever since. </div>
<h3 style= "text-align:index"> Introduction</h3>
<p style= "font-size:14pt"> As one of the earliest musical instruments in China, Zheng has a history of 2400 years, 
and that is why it is also called Guzheng, (Gu means ancient). People named Zheng according to its sound, 
and it has been appreciated for over 20 centuries because of its unique sound: gentle and powerful. </p>

<p style="font-size:14pt"> Zheng has been played since it was invented while other musical <i>instruments</i> like konghou has diminished, 
and instruments like yangqin and erhu were introduced to people. Zheng is always there because of its unique and beautiful sound,
 and the satisfaction for both refined and popular taste. Looking back to the development of Zheng, 
 the economy in China is a decisive factor behind its popularity. Zheng has a brighter future due to the increasing <abbr title="Growth National Product">GNP</abbr> in China,
 and globalization brought it to a world stage.
 I am confident that this ancient Chinese instrument and the culture will continue to pass down generations to come.</p>
